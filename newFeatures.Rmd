## Feature Engineering

This document outlines the new features (variables) created in each of the datasets in an attempt to improve model performance

## Teams

yearsD1 = the number of years the team has been or was D1. Note, this may be target leakage, see example below:

```{r teams, echo = TRUE}
teams <- mutate(teams,
                yearsD1 = LastD1Season - FirstD1Season
                )

filter(teams,
       LastD1Season == 2010
       )
```

If yearsD1 was used in predicting the 2009 tourney, then there is target leakage. Will need to account for this.
